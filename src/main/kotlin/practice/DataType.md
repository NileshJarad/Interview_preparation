## Data types


#### Float vs Double

##### Float
- A float is a 32-bit IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point number.
- 1 bit for the sign , 8 bits for the exponent and  23 bits for the value
- A float has 7 decimal digits of precision and occupies 32 bits.

#### Double 
- A double is a 64-bit IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point number
- 1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the value
- A double has 15 decimal digits of precision and occupies a total of 64 bits.
